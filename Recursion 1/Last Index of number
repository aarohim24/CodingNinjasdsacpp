Problem statement
Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.

Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.

You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).

Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

Sample Input :
4
9 8 10 8
8
Sample Output :
3

//CODE
int lastIndex(int input[], int size, int x) {
    if (size == 0)
        return -1;
    int lastIndexInRest = lastIndex(input + 1, size - 1, x);
    if (lastIndexInRest != -1)
        return lastIndexInRest + 1;
    if (input[0] == x)
        return 0;
    return -1;
}
