Problem statement
You are given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. It contains only 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list in a 'single scan'.

'Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.

Note:
1. You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything. 
2. You are not allowed to sort the list/array directly.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
7
0 1 2 0 2 0 1
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 1 2 2 
Explanation:  The array contains three 0s, two 1s, and two 2s. After sorting the array in a single scan, the 0s should come first, then the 1s, and finally the 2s. So the output is 0 0 0 1 1 2 2.
Sample Input 2:
2
5
2 2 0 1 1
7
0 1 2 0 1 2 0
Sample Output 2:
0 1 1 2 2 
Explanation: The array contains one 0, two 1s, and two 2s. After sorting, the 0 comes first, then the 1s, and finally the 2s. So the output is 0 1 1 2 2.
0 0 0 1 1 2 2
Explanation: The array contains three 0s, two 1s, and two 2s. After sorting, the 0s come first, then the 1s, and finally the 2s. So the output is 0 0 0 1 1 2 2.

//code
void sort012(int *arr, int n) {
    int low = 0; 
    int mid = 0; 
    int high = n - 1; 

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (arr[mid] == 0) {
            std::swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        }
        else {
            std::swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}
