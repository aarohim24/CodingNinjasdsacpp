Problem statement
Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.



Find and print the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm.



For printing MST follow the steps -

1. In one line, print an edge which is part of MST in the format - 
v1 v2 w
where, v1 and v2 are the vertices of the edge which is included in MST and whose weight is w. And v1  <= v2 i.e. print the smaller vertex first while printing an edge.
2. Print V-1 edges in above format in different lines.
Note: Order of different edges doesn't matter.
