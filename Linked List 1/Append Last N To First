Problem statement
You have been given a singly linked list of integers along with an integer 'N'. Write a function to append the last 'N' nodes towards the front of the singly linked list and returns the new head to the list.

Hint:
Identify how many pointers you require and try traversing them to right places and connect nodes accordingly also don't forget to disconnect what's required else it could create cycles.

Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
0 <= N < M
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
Sample Input 1 :
2
1 2 3 4 5 -1
3
10 20 30 40 50 60 -1
5
Sample Output 1 :
3 4 5 1 2
20 30 40 50 60 10
Sample Input 2 :
1
10 6 77 90 61 67 100 -1
4
Sample Output 2 :
90 61 67 100 10 6 77 
 Explanation to Sample Input 2 :
We have been required to move the last 4 nodes to the front of the list. Here, "90->61->67->100" is the list which represents the last 4 nodes. When we move this list to the front then the remaining part of the initial list which is, "10->6->77" is attached after 100. Hence, the new list formed with an updated head pointing to 90.

//code

Node *appendLastNToFirst(Node *head, int n) {
    if (head == nullptr || n <= 0) {
        return head;
    }
    
    int length = 0;
    Node *current = head;
    // Calculate the length of the linked list
    while (current != nullptr) {
        length++;
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    // If n is greater than or equal to the length of the list, no change is needed
    if (n >= length) {
        return head;
    }
    
    // Find the node at (length - n) position
    current = head;
    for (int i = 1; i < length - n; i++) {
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    // Save the node next to the (length - n) node
    Node *temp = current->next;
    // Set the next of (length - n) node to null to break the list
    current->next = nullptr;
    
    // Traverse to the end of the list and connect it to the head
    Node *temp2 = temp;
    while (temp2->next != nullptr) {
        temp2 = temp2->next;
    }
    temp2->next = head;
    
    // Update the head to point to the node after (length - n) node
    head = temp;
    
    return head;
}
