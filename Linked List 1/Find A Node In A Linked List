Problem statement
You have been given a singly linked list of integers. Write a function that returns the index/position of integer data denoted by 'N' (if it exists). Return -1 otherwise.

Note :
Assume that the Indexing for the singly linked list always starts from 0.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
 Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
2
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
5
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 -1
6
Sample Output 1 :
2
-1
 Explanation for Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, 'N' = 5 appears at position 2 (0-based indexing) in the given linked list.

In test case 2, we can see that 'N' = 6 is not present in the given linked list.
Sample Input 2 :
2
1 -1
2
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
6
Sample Output 2 :
-1
4
 Explanation for Sample Output 2:
In test case 1, we can see that 'N' = 2 is not present in the given linked list.

In test case 2, 'N' = 6 appears at position 4 (0-based indexing) in the given linked list.

//code

int findNode(Node *head, int n) {
    int pos = 0;
    Node *current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        if (current->data == n) {
            return pos;
        }
        current = current->next;
        pos++;
    }
    return -1;
}
