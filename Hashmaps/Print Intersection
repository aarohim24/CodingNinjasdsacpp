Problem statement
You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.

The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the second array/list (ARR2).

//code

  if (n == 0 || m == 0) {
    return;
  }

  unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    freqMap[arr2[i]]++; 
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    if (freqMap.count(arr1[i]) > 0 && freqMap[arr1[i]] > 0) {
      cout << arr1[i] << endl;
      freqMap[arr1[i]]--; 
    }
  }
