Problem statement
Rishabh and Harshit has just learnt about the concept of friend function. As Harshit is a fast learner, he gave Rishabh a task to complete the definition of the friend function code. Given the main function and the definition of the "returnandprint" function, help Rishabh to write the definiton of two classes :

1. Create the definiton of "parent" class which has a public function named "returnandprint"

2.Write the definition of "isFriend" class which has one private string named "x" , one protected string named "y" and a friend function of parent class named "returnandprint".

Note
Take the same name of variables as mentioned and do not print anything
Sample Output:
Rishabh Harshit
15
Explanation:
No input has to be taken by the user. Just complete the required code.


//code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


class parent {
public:
    int returnandprint();
};

class isFriend {
private:
    string x;
protected:
    string y;  // Protected member
    friend int parent::returnandprint();
};
