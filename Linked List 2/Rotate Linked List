Problem statement
You are given a linked list having ‘n’ nodes and an integer ‘k’.



You have to rotate the linked list to the right by ‘k’ positions .



Example :
Input: linked list = [1 2 3 4] , k = 2

Output: 3 4 1 2

Explanation:
We have to rotate the given linked list to the right 2 times. After rotating it to the right once it becomes 4->1->2->3. After rotating it to the right again, it becomes 3->4->1->2. 


Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
2


Sample Output 1 :
5 6 1 2 3 4


Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case, after 1st clockwise rotation the modified linked list will be : 6->1->2->3->4->5
After, 2nd clockwise rotated the modified linked list will be : 5->6->1->2->3->4.
Thus the output is: 5 6 1 2 3 4.


Sample Input 2 :
3
3 6 9 
0


Sample Output 2:
3 6 9


Explanation For Sample Input 2 :
In this test case, ‘k’ is 0 therefore there will be no rotation, so the linked list remains unchanged.


Expected Time Complexity:
Try to do this in O(n).


Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= Node.data <= 10^9 
0 <= k <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec

Node *rotate(Node *head, int k) {

        length++;
        current = current->next;

    length++; 

    int effectiveRotation = k % length;
    if (effectiveRotation == 0) {

    Node *newTail = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < length - effectiveRotation - 1; i++) {
        newTail = newTail->next;
    }

    current->next = head;

    head = newTail->next;
    newTail->next = nullptr;

    return head;
